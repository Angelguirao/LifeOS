# Backend Structure Document

This document explains the backend of LifeOS, a web-based Life Operating System. LifeOS transforms everyday experiences into a dynamic knowledge graph to guide users toward a meaningful life. The backend is designed to be scalable, secure, and easily maintainable, fitting the needs of lifelogging and quantified-self enthusiasts.

## 1. Backend Architecture

The backend follows a modular monolith architecture initially with a planned transition to a hybrid serverless design as the project scales. This covers the current requirements while ensuring future adaptability.

- **Modular Monolith:**
  - The core domain logic and feature modules reside in separate codebases under a monolithic repository. This keeps the structure clean and enables easy iterations.
  - Domain-Driven Design is used to manage complexity by clearly segmenting concerns and ensuring that business logic is tightly aligned with each feature.

- **Scalability & Transition:**
  - On reaching a trigger (user growth, increased data complexity), the architecture will transition to a hybrid model, leveraging serverless functions (e.g., AWS Lambda) for stateless operations.
  - GraphQL may be adopted alongside RESTful endpoints to manage complex queries and relationships inherent to the dynamic knowledge graph.

- **Frameworks and Libraries:**
  - The backend is built on Supabase, which provides PostgreSQL as the primary database and Edge Functions to run custom logic. 
  - Redis caching is incorporated for efficient data retrieval.

## 2. Database Management

LifeOS uses a combination of technologies to store and manage data efficiently.

- **Primary Database:**
  - **Supabase (PostgreSQL):**
    - A robust SQL-based relational database hosted in the cloud.
    - Utilized for structured data and relational queries.
    
- **Caching:**
  - **Redis:**
    - Provides in-memory caching to reduce response times and improve performance.

- **Additional Data Stores:**
  - **Pinecone (Vector Database):**
    - Used for AI integration, specifically for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) operations.
  - **Optional NoSQL Databases:**
    - Future possibilities include using MongoDB or DynamoDB for flexible document storage as data complexity grows.

- **Data Management Practices:**
  - Data is organized into logical domains with clear relationships.
  - Routine backups, integrity checks, and audit logs are maintained to ensure data consistency and compliance with data privacy regulations like GDPR.

## 3. Database Schema

### Overview

Data in LifeOS is modeled to cater to various areas of operation including user accounts, captured data streams, AI insights, and permission records. The schema is designed for clarity and efficiency.

### Human Readable Format

- **Users Table:** Holds user profile information along with authentication details provided by Clerk Auth.
- **Data Streams Table:** Stores records of captured information from ebooks, emails, documents, wearable devices, etc.
- **AI Insights Table:** Contains results from AI analysis such as key insights, mental models, and associative links between data bits.
- **Permissions Table:** Manages user roles and granular access rights (Owner, Collaborator, and Viewer) for various data entities.
- **Audit Logs Table:** Records all significant actions for monitoring and security purposes.

### Sample PostgreSQL Schema

Below is an example of how the schema might be implemented in PostgreSQL:

```
-- Users Table
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Data Streams Table
CREATE TABLE data_streams (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
    source VARCHAR(100), -- e.g., email, wearable, document
    data JSONB NOT NULL,
    captured_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- AI Insights Table
CREATE TABLE ai_insights (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    data_stream_id INTEGER REFERENCES data_streams(id),
    insights JSONB NOT NULL,
    generated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Permissions Table
CREATE TABLE permissions (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
    entity_id INTEGER,
    entity_type VARCHAR(50),
    role VARCHAR(50) -- e.g., Owner, Collaborator, Viewer
);

-- Audit Logs Table
CREATE TABLE audit_logs (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
    action VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    performed_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## 4. API Design and Endpoints

The APIs of LifeOS are thoughtfully designed to integrate and communicate effectively between frontend and backend components.

- **API Design Style:**
  - **RESTful APIs:**
    - The initial implementation follows RESTful principles using Supabase Edge Functions for server-side logic.
  
  - **Future GraphQL Adoption:**
    - As the data interactions grow more complex, especially with dynamic relationships inherent in a knowledge graph, GraphQL will be introduced to allow more flexible data queries.

- **Key Endpoints:**
  - **Capture Endpoints:**
    - Endpoints to capture data from various sources (ebooks, emails, messages, devices) via standardized REST APIs.
  
  - **Analyze Endpoints:**
    - Endpoints that integrate with the OpenAI API to analyze captured data and return insights.
  
  - **Connect Endpoints:**
    - Endpoints that manage user profiles, personas, permission settings, and facilitate data sharing both within the system and with external platforms (e.g., Facebook, Slack, Google Drive, Dropbox).
  
  - **Authentication Endpoints:**
    - Managed through Clerk Auth for secure user authentication and session management.

## 5. Hosting Solutions

The backend of LifeOS leverages cloud-based services to ensure reliability and scalability.

- **Primary Hosting:**
  - **Supabase:**
    - Provides a managed PostgreSQL database along with Edge Functions.
  
  - **Cloud Providers:**
    - Initially hosted on cloud infrastructure that supports Supabase, with plans to integrate AWS Lambda for serverless functions during scalability transitions.

- **Benefits of Chosen Solutions:**
  - High reliability and automatic scaling based on usage patterns.
  - Cost-effective usage-based billing.
  - Seamless deployment and integration with CI/CD pipelines (using GitHub Actions and Infrastructure-as-Code with Pulumi/Terraform).

## 6. Infrastructure Components

The infrastructure of LifeOS is structured to support high performance and user satisfaction through policy-driven components.

- **Load Balancers:**
  - Ensure that incoming requests are evenly distributed across server instances to prevent any single node from becoming a bottleneck.
  
- **Caching Mechanisms:**
  - **Redis:**
    - Speeds up frequent data queries and reduces load on the primary database by caching recurring requests.
  
- **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs):**
  - Used to deliver static assets (images, JS, CSS) quickly to users all around the globe.
  
- **API Gateways & Edge Functions:**
  - Gateways manage API routing while Edge Functions in Supabase handle tasks close to the end-user, reducing latency.

## 7. Security Measures

Security is a top priority for LifeOS. The system employs a comprehensive set of protocols to protect user data and maintain compliance with privacy regulations.

- **Encryption:**
  - End-to-end encryption is enforced using TLS 1.3 for data in transit.
  - Sensitive data is secured with AES-256 encryption at rest.

- **Authentication & Authorization:**
  - Clerk Auth manages user authentication with robust session handling.
  - Granular permission settings allow users to control access (Owner, Collaborator, Viewer) across different data streams.

- **Compliance and Auditing:**
  - GDPR compliance is maintained through strict data management practices.
  - Regular audits and penetration testing help identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.

- **Access Controls:**
  - Every endpoint and service interaction is secured by access control policies and audit logs.

## 8. Monitoring and Maintenance

Regular monitoring and proactive maintenance ensure that LifeOS remains performant and secure.

- **Monitoring Tools:**
  - Use of built-in Supabase metrics and third-party cloud monitoring solutions to track system performance.
  - Logging mechanisms are in place to trace API usage, error rates, and security incidents.

- **Maintenance Strategies:**
  - CI/CD processes managed via GitHub Actions ensure prompt deployment of updates and patches.
  - Infrastructure-as-Code setups (Pulumi/Terraform) allow rapid provisioning and recovery of components.
  - Scheduled security audits and performance reviews to preemptively address potential issues.
