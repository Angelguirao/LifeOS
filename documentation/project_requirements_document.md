# LifeOS Project Requirements Document

---

## 1. Project Overview

LifeOS is a web-based Life Operating System designed to be much more than a digital repository. It serves as an intelligent compass that not only preserves your personal data—from ebooks, emails, photos, and wearable device data—but also actively transforms that data into meaningful insights. Inspired by concepts like Gordon Bell’s MyLifeBits, LifeOS uses advanced AI and dynamic graph-based linking to create a living, interconnected knowledge network that keeps you informed, engaged, and reflective about your personal journey.

The purpose of building LifeOS is to empower lifelogging and quantified-self enthusiasts to organize, analyze, and share their digital legacy in a secure, intuitive, and enriching way. By integrating diverse data sources and using AI to highlight patterns and recommend insights, the platform helps users gain deep self-awareness and make informed decisions. Success for LifeOS will mean achieving a seamless data capture process, delivering accurate and personalized AI-driven insights, and maintaining utmost user privacy with customizable sharing.

## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

**In-Scope:**
- Seamless data capture and integration from diverse sources, including emails (using IMAP and platforms like Gmail/Microsoft Graph API), wearable devices (Apple HealthKit, Google Fit), instant messages, documents, photos, videos, and ebooks.
- Automated processing to extract key ideas, mental models, and contextual metadata from ebooks and other documents using the OpenAI API.
- Dynamic graph-based linking that mirrors human cognition, allowing the generation of associative links across different information streams.
- Interactive visualizations and dashboards built with Chart.js (and D3.js for custom visualizations) that display data insights, memory diaries, and analytical tools.
- Implementation of custom personas with fine-grained privacy controls, enabling selective sharing with different user roles (Owner, Collaborator, Viewer).
- A modular monolith architecture initially, with an eye towards a future transition to a hybrid serverless model when scalability demands increase.
- Secure integration using standard protocols (TLS 1.3, AES-256) and GDPR-compliant data handling.

**Out-of-Scope:**
- Advanced custom AI model training or fine-tuning right out of the gate. The initial implementation will solely use off-the-shelf OpenAI models.
- Native mobile apps; LifeOS will be built as a responsive web application initially.
- Complete social media integration for sharing (extensions with external platforms like Facebook or LinkedIn will be considered later).
- Complex, enterprise-level analytics dashboards beyond the user’s personal insights and tracking initially.
- Extensive custom branding design beyond a neutral modern look; detailed visual identity guidelines may be refined in later phases.

## 3. User Flow

When a new user arrives on LifeOS, they are greeted by a clean, minimalistic landing page that immediately communicates the platform's core benefits. They begin by registering with secure authentication powered by Clerk Auth, and during registration, they receive contextual guidance with brief tips outlining the platform’s value. Once signed up, users are ushered into an interactive onboarding process that includes guided tours and tutorial pop-ups, helping them set up personalized privacy settings, connect external accounts, and start configuring their knowledge graph.

After the initial setup, users experience a smooth journey where LifeOS continuously integrates their data from emails, wearable devices, instant messages, ebooks, and other media. As the data accumulates, the AI processes and enriches it, creating dynamic associative links that can be explored via interactive dashboards and visualizations. Users can delve into their memory diaries, track personal trends, and access tailored recommendations, all while retaining complete control through customizable personas and granular privacy settings. The overall flow is designed to make data capture and insight discovery feel like a natural extension of everyday life.

  - Initial reliance on off-the-shelf OpenAI models with the possibility of fine-tuning later.
  - The transition from a modular monolith to a hybrid serverless architecture depends on specific performance and user growth criteria.
  - The immediate branding/design approach is neutral and modern, with potential for more bespoke design guidelines in future iterations.

- **Assumptions:**
  - Users are primarily lifelogging and quantified-self enthusiasts who seek both comprehensive data capture and analytical insights.
  - The underlying infrastructure (e.g., Supabase, Redis, Pinecone) remains stable and scales in line with user growth.
  - The OpenAI API and other service integrations are available and reliable at the time of deployment.
  - Adequate developer resources and tooling (such as Cursor, Turborepo, Pulumi/Terraform) are available to support rapid development and maintenance.

## 8. Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

- **API Dependency & Rate Limits:**
  - Integration with multiple third-party APIs (email, wearables, messaging, cloud services) may face rate limit issues or changes in API terms. It will be essential to build robust error handling and fallback strategies.
  
- **Data Complexity & Integration Challenges:**
  - Consolidating and normalizing data from a wide variety of sources may prove complex. There is a risk of inconsistent data quality or format, requiring thorough data sanitization and indexing strategies.
  
- **Security & Privacy:**
  - Ensuring data privacy and compliance with regulations like GDPR is critical. Any lapses could result in legal challenges or breaches of user trust. Continuous monitoring, regular audits, and strict access control policies are necessary.
  
- **Scalability on Transition:**
  - The planned architectural transition to a hybrid serverless model may present unexpected technical hurdles. Monitoring performance metrics closely and having predefined criteria for triggering the transition will help mitigate risks.
  
- **User Experience & Onboarding:**
  - Creating a balance between powerful features and user accessibility is challenging. The onboarding process must be seamless to avoid overwhelming users while ensuring they are aware of all functionalities.
  
This detailed PRD should serve as the primary blueprint for all subsequent technical documents and guide the development of LifeOS without ambiguity.
