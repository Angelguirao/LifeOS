# LifeOS App Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up
Upon arriving at LifeOS, new users are greeted with a clean, minimalistic landing page that immediately communicates the purpose of the platform as a Life Operating System. The landing page clearly outlines the benefits of digitizing, processing, and connecting various aspects of one’s personal information into a rich, AI-enhanced knowledge graph. New users are invited to create an account using a straightforward registration process powered by Clerk Auth. They can register using their email address or opt for social logins if they prefer, ensuring secure authentication and a smooth sign-up process. As part of registration, users are prompted to verify their email address and are given succinct contextual tips about the app’s key features. For those who already have an account, a simple sign-in option is available. In addition, if a user ever forgets their password, the app offers a clear and accessible password recovery option that uses secure verification methods. Signing out is equally simple, with an always visible and easily accessible logout button ensuring that users can leave the platform with confidence in the security of their session.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page
Once signed in, users are introduced to a well-organized main dashboard that serves as the central hub of LifeOS. The dashboard is designed to be clear and welcoming, featuring an intuitive layout with a header that displays essential navigation elements and user account information. A sidebar or navigation menu allows users to easily access the different sections of LifeOS, such as data capture, analysis and visualizations, memory diaries, and settings. Interactive widgets display real-time insights and personalized recommendations, while central areas highlight the dynamic knowledge graph built from their integrated data. This home page acts as the starting point for a range of user activities, making it clear how users can navigate to deeper features or access guided tours and tutorials available for first-time users.

The dashboard serves as a central hub that balances structured data visualization with space for unstructured reflection. The interface features:

- A multi-modal capture system for events, thoughts, actions, and states
- Real-time emotion, energy, and attention tracking
- Dynamic knowledge graph visualization powered by Neo4j
- AI-powered insight engine using OpenAI + Pinecone
- Custom visualizations built with D3.js and Chart.js
- File management interface for S3-compatible storage

The sidebar navigation provides clear access to different aspects of the system while maintaining a clean, uncluttered aesthetic.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

### Core Data Flows
- **Event Capture Flow**
  - Users can log events with rich contextual metadata
  - Each entry supports emotion, energy, and attention tracking
  - AI automatically generates summaries and semantic links
  - Events are stored in MongoDB for flexibility

- **Knowledge Graph Flow**
  - Neo4j powers the semantic relationship system
  - Users can create typed, directional relationships (caused_by, inspired_by, reflects_on)
  - AI suggests potential connections between events and ideas
  - Interactive graph visualization for exploration

- **File Management Flow**
  - S3-compatible storage for documents, images, and audio
  - Automatic metadata extraction and linking
  - Privacy-aware sharing controls
  - Integration with the semantic graph

After the initial registration and onboard tour, users progress through a series of detailed flows that build the full LifeOS experience. The first step is a guided setup and personalization process whereby users configure their privacy settings, connect external accounts, and select initial knowledge categories. In this setup, users have the opportunity to link diverse data sources—ranging from emails (accessed via the IMAP protocol and APIs like Gmail or Microsoft Graph) to wearable device data (from Apple HealthKit or Google Fit), and even instant messages and documents using authenticated RESTful APIs. Once setup is complete, the background processes begin to aggregate and transform this data into a dynamic, interconnected knowledge base. Advanced AI techniques using off-the-shelf models from the OpenAI API immediately process ebooks, photos, videos, and other documents, extracting key ideas, mental models, and contextual metadata. The insights are then presented visually through interactive dashboards powered by libraries such as Chart.js and, for more complex scenarios, D3.js. Users can interact with these visualizations and memory diaries, exploring patterns in their data and receiving personalized guidance through on-screen recommendations. Page transitions are smooth and intuitive, enabling a fluid shift between data input pages, analytical dashboards, and interactive exploration of the knowledge graph. For advanced users or administrators, additional pages such as an admin panel or custom sharing settings are available, ensuring that every transition further enriches the user's understanding and control over their digital legacy.

## Settings and Account Management
The settings and account management section is designed to give users full control over their personal information and preferences within LifeOS. Users can easily access this section from the main navigation menu. Within the settings area, users are able to update personal details, configure notifications, and adjust data integration preferences, ensuring that the system is always aligned with their needs. A unique feature of LifeOS is the ability to create customizable personas. In the settings, users can create, modify, and delete these personas, each with its own set of granular privacy controls and permission settings. This area also supports billing and subscription management where applicable, allowing users to review their payment methods or subscription tiers. After making any changes, a clearly marked option guides the user back to the main dashboard so that the overall journey remains uninterrupted and continuously integrated with their evolving life data.

### Privacy & Persona Management
- Granular privacy scopes (Owner, Collaborator, Viewer)
- Complete data export and deletion capabilities
- Self-hosting configuration options
- Persona layer management for different contexts

## Error States and Alternate Paths
LifeOS incorporates robust error handling to ensure that users experience minimal disruption. When users enter invalid data or experience connectivity issues, the app immediately displays clear, human-readable error messages that explain the problem in simple terms. For instance, if a user enters incorrect login credentials, the system provides a concise error message along with an option to reset the password. Similarly, if data integration from external sources fails due to connectivity issues, fallback pages appear to inform the user that the system is attempting to reconnect and update the information as soon as possible. In cases where a user attempts to access restricted pages or performs actions beyond their permission level, the platform presents a consistent error page offering explanations and guidance on how to proceed. These error states ensure that even unforeseen interruptions are managed in a way that helps users quickly regain normal operation and continue with their daily interactions on LifeOS.

### Hybrid Database Handling
- Graceful degradation if any database component (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Neo4j, Pinecone) becomes temporarily unavailable
- Clear user feedback about sync status across different storage systems
- Offline capability for basic event logging
- Recovery procedures for maintaining data consistency

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey
The entire journey of using LifeOS is designed to be a seamless progression from onboarding to everyday use. New users begin with an inviting and guided registration process that clearly explains the value of the platform. The initial setup, enriched with interactive tutorials and personalized configurations, ensures that users are empowered to integrate their diverse data streams from the outset. Once the data begins to flow, the LifeOS dashboard becomes the central point where intelligent analysis and personalized visualizations converge, guiding users toward deeper insights and more meaningful self-reflection. With robust privacy controls and tailored settings, users remain in complete control of their digital legacy while enjoying a continuously refined experience driven by real-time analytics and feedback. The system gracefully handles errors or interruptions, underscoring that life's complexity is met with a resilient and thoughtful digital companion. In summary, LifeOS offers an integrated, intuitive, and secure journey that evolves with the user, merging technology and personal insight to create a truly life-enriching experience.

LifeOS creates a unique journey that acknowledges both the computable and uncomputable aspects of life. While it provides powerful tools for structuring and analyzing personal data, it also maintains space for the messy, poetic, and irreducibly human elements of existence. The system's hybrid database architecture, combined with its AI capabilities and privacy-first approach, creates a platform that grows and evolves with the user while respecting the inherent complexity and mystery of human experience.

Through free-form journaling, emotional metadata, fuzzy AI linking, and time-based transitions, LifeOS allows the unstructured and uncertain to coexist alongside structured data. It serves not just as software, but as a mirror for self-awareness and a canvas for lived experience—quantized, yet still maintaining the essential poetry of life.
